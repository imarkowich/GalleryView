# GalleryView
This app is a gallery for images.

The user can view a 3 column scrollable gallery of 20+ images.
Tapping an image will bring up a detailed view of the image.
Swiping left or right on a detailed image will traverse the other images.

NOTE: This App was designed on VS for Mac. If your build is not running, 
try cleaning the entire solution before debugging.
